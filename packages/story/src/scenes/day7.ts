/**
 * DAY 7 — breath, then the branch (design/act1-beats.md §Day 7).
 *
 * Single quiet morning slot (the register briefly open — thread beat 2, no
 * comment from anyone), a short early-fog evening, and then the act's one
 * railroad: the walk to the wharf at 3:12 and THE FOGHORN CHOICE. The act
 * ends on the walk back up and the ACT TWO title card ('act1-end' ending
 * marker terminates the current build; Act 2 replaces it).
 *
 * Flags this file owns (Act 2 branches on them):
 *   'horn-on'              — the player told Wade to keep playing
 *   'horn-stopped'         — the player closed the valve herself
 *   'wade-confession-seed' — Wade's confession path opens early (horn-on)
 * Facts: 'let-wade-play' / 'stopped-the-horn', witnessed by wade only.
 * The presence-decay mechanic itself is Act 2's; Act 1 only announces it —
 * the '(Something has started counting.)' visual tell rides the lie-down
 * choice out of d7-after (playtest fix-03: it is the LAST thing Act 1 says).
 *
 * Prose invariants in force (design/game-bible.md §Prose grammar): nobody
 * touches you first — in the Stop branch YOU reach past Wade and touch the
 * HORN, never him; nobody remarks that anything is strange.
